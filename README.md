Problem:
Climate change is altering our planet, causing extreme weather events like tropical storms, wildfires, severe droughts and heat waves, negatively affecting crop production, causing disruption to animalsâ€™ natural habitats, and more. Because the emission of greenhouse gases is the main perpetrator that causes global warming
Carbon emissions are one type of greenhouse gas emission that happens when carbon dioxide enters the air after a human activity or process. They are crucial to this conversation because they are the most significant type of emission in terms of quantity. Carbon dioxide gets released into the atmosphere after everyday human processes like driving a vehicle, the agricultural industry, and more. 

Solution: 

AQI Application::

Air quality is measured with the Air Quality Index, or AQI. The AQI works like a thermometer that runs from 0 to 500 degrees. However, instead of showing changes in the temperature, the AQI is a way of showing changes in the amount of pollution in the air. Air quality is a measure of how clean or polluted the air is.

Proposed Model for the AQI Application:

The Proposed model of the system is as follows. The block diagram of the system is showing that for a particular area selected how will it work. The device will be set up to take the environmental data and there will be a base standard value. The device will collect data and based on the set values it will show the output.

The 3 Layer Architecture![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86153443/122644364-723b7000-d132-11eb-847c-101dc97b651c.png)

The Database layer: The layer which contains the normalized real data for different areas based on region or location user is currently looking at using IBM Cloud DB. This is written in SQL language that keeps connection with database.
The Application Layer: Takes initiative for implementation of the back-end codes which is mainly HTML and then .NET. Back-end programming is the structure of the webpage and is the core part of a webpage.
The Client Layer: It is about design portion of a web page where all the design works and layout of the page contains properly. Front end is all about user interface and what are visible to the user.
